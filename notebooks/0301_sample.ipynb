Any utopian community must interface with the rest of the currently-not-utopian world. I suspect the utopian aspect can only be maintained if that interface is very small and restricted. Otherwise the property-based wider society will grow to dominate and maximally exploit the utopia, as is its nature. This concept is explored in The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin.\n",

Emacs is the last bastion of a different path down the tree of personal computing than the one our species took, one in which individual users are empowered and not - as is now the case - held hostage by us[0] in our ivory towers of impenetrable layers of cryptic technology.\\n\\nEmacs was made for humans to use as a real tool. Barely anything else in the tech world really qualifies to the same degree. I'd love to peek into the parallel universe where we stuck to introspectable, malleable software and ended up with something closer to the Houyhnhnm computing stack[1]. Alas, for now that ship has sailed.\\n\\nSee also: That old story about Emacs at Amazon, etc.\\n\\n[0]: \"tech people\"\\n\\n[1]: https://ngnghm.github.io/\n",

And that was always so. Only when we look at the past creations, we can only experience those that were good enough to be preserved.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure that Fifty Shades of Grey wasn't successful for its story, but for discussing sex and specifically BDSM in a more open way than what was previously seen in \"mainstream\" movies.\\n\\nOverall, a lot of works that, on the surface, aren't very impressive by current standards, but still managed to stand out in a novel way. Fifty shades and Half Life are two examples, but you could say exactly the same thing about Minecraft, DOOM, most of the classical movies, most of the old \"legendary\" cars and a lot more.

There was also a movie where you get to get choices linked to Black Mirror that was popular recently, and a few people on youtube explored this by making different videos and letting you pick \"what happens next\".\\n\\nThere's also the whole genre of visual novels, mostly from Japan. I'm not sure if they are more games, books or interactive fiction.   \n",

Plus, Apple uses the fact that most subscribers to app store products subscribe on the app store itself to bolster their case with regulators that no reform is needed bc consumers are overwhelmingly happy to use Apple’s IAP systems.

       "199  You're right on two accounts:\\n- Google gets paid no matter who pays, so they don't care\\n- Tinder still gets the revenue (and at better margins bc they're not actually have to pay for that user anymore - Apple is paying)\\n\\nAnd even your last point is not wrong: at some point Apple may stop doing this. But that could be year's away, and in the meantime, they're throwing their big stack around to make it too costly for developers - who Apple supposedly partners with - to build businesses that are less dependent on Apple’s whims. Plus, Apple uses the fact that most subscribers to app store products subscribe on the app store itself to bolster their case with regulators that no reform is needed bc consumers are overwhelmingly happy to use Apple’s IAP systems. But if Apple is putting it's finger on the scales in order to actively drive users away from web subscriptions, then they heavily misleading these regulators about the true “choices” consumers are making.   \n",

He gets a commission for a painting, and slowly starts mixing paints for weeks.  Then he has an epiphany about an interesting paint mix, and gets lost into mixing paints for weeks on end.  He ends up not delivering on his commitment.\\n\\nAnother example: he spent a lot of time dissecting human corpses and horses and made many draft drawings.  Then he declares in his notebook something like, \"I'm going to write a treatise on human anatomy; it will be better than those created by surgeons because I can draw exploded views of arms and muscles from different angles.\"  He never finishes it.

But most particularly it seems that Protestant Christianity is haunted by an existential terror of the imaginary.[2]  At the very core of Christian teaching is the unease around Jesus' use of parables (constructs of fiction designed to reveal truth, a contradiction which has resulted in the use of much ink dedicated to the explication of how the former is not really involved at all). It could be argued to hearken back (conceptually) even to the \"Tree of Knowledge\", where original sin is no longer sex but knowledge itself (which would include knowledge of sex).\\n\\n[1] The Novel-Reading Panic in 18th Century in England: An Outline of an Early Moral Media Panic  --- \\n   https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Novel-Reading-Panic-in-18-th-Century-in-England-Vogrin/ea07e5f58509e8b2bf9db1f9777b9ef614294825\\n\\...\n",

Nesse<p>The author digs into the idea that humans may have evolved to a certain extent to have good reasons for bad feelings. Several fascinating cases are cited and it made me realise how feelings can be a warning of something. Maybe a bit like when we eat too much salt or sweet then the body reacts. Emotions could work like that but perhaps in a less tangible way.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penguinrandomhouse.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;546633&#x2F;good-reasons-for-bad-feelings-by-randolph-m-nesse-md&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penguinrandomhouse.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;546633&#x2F;good-reasons...</a>   \n",

I remember reading it initially out of curiosity to know who this historic figure was and after finishing feeling like my eyes were opened to the reality of the world around us. As a person of color who didn&#x27;t think too much about racial justice previously, it woke me up to injustices that I did not notice before.<p>I should read it again as well.   \n",

       "28717289  Written in short form and taken at face value, I can see why you may have this reaction to his writing. Read the sovereign individual, basically his thoughts in long form. Thiel even writes the pre-face to the book.<p>His main arguments are that politics divides, democracy favors the 51% at the expense of the 49%. He is for smaller government, less political divides, and the abandonment of the welfare state that creates a government dependent population with incredible waste. His ideas are not all that radical, considering debt spending by world governments is currently unsustainable.<p>People are largely irrational &amp; bias. The thing about morality is everyone thinks they have the answers leading the government to be this odd form of paternalism where seemingly simple statements like &quot;No drugs&quot; are taken to this extreme that lead to more societal harm than good.   \n",

Nesse\\n\\nThe author digs into the idea that humans may have evolved to a certain extent to have good reasons for bad feelings. Several fascinating cases are cited and it made me realise how feelings can be a warning of something. Maybe a bit like when we eat too much salt or sweet then the body reacts. Emotions could work like that but perhaps in a less tangible way.\\n\\nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546633/good-reasons-for-bad-feelings-by-randolph-m-nesse-md/   \n",

       "28717289  Written in short form and taken at face value, I can see why you may have this reaction to his writing. Read the sovereign individual, basically his thoughts in long form. Thiel even writes the pre-face to the book.\\n\\nHis main arguments are that politics divides, democracy favors the 51% at the expense of the 49%. He is for smaller government, less political divides, and the abandonment of the welfare state that creates a government dependent population with incredible waste. His ideas are not all that radical, considering debt spending by world governments is currently unsustainable.\\n\\nPeople are largely irrational & bias. The thing about morality is everyone thinks they have the answers leading the government to be this odd form of paternalism where seemingly simple statements like \"No drugs\" are taken to this extreme that lead to more societal harm than good.   \n",

Thiel even writes the pre-face to the book.\\n\\nHis main arguments are that politics divides, democracy favors the 51% at the expense of the 49%. He is for smaller government, less political divides, and the abandonment of the welfare state that creates a government dependent population with incredible waste. His ideas are not all that radical, considering debt spending by world governments is currently unsustainable.\\n\\nPeople are largely irrational & bias.

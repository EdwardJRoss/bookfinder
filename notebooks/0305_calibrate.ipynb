And that was always so. Only when we look at the past creations, we can only experience those that were good enough to be preserved.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure that Fifty Shades of Grey wasn't successful for its story, but for discussing sex and specifically BDSM in a more open way than what was previously seen in \"mainstream\" movies.\\n\\nOverall, a lot of works that, on the surface, aren't very impressive by current standards, but still managed to stand out in a novel way. Fifty shades and Half Life are two examples, but you could say exactly the same thing about Minecraft, DOOM, most of the classical movies, most of the old \"legendary\" cars and a lot more.

There was also a movie where you get to get choices linked to Black Mirror that was popular recently, and a few people on youtube explored this by making different videos and letting you pick \"what happens next\".\\n\\nThere's also the whole genre of visual novels, mostly from Japan. I'm not sure if they are more games, books or interactive fiction.   \n",

Plus, Apple uses the fact that most subscribers to app store products subscribe on the app store itself to bolster their case with regulators that no reform is needed bc consumers are overwhelmingly happy to use Apple’s IAP systems.

       "199  You're right on two accounts:\\n- Google gets paid no matter who pays, so they don't care\\n- Tinder still gets the revenue (and at better margins bc they're not actually have to pay for that user anymore - Apple is paying)\\n\\nAnd even your last point is not wrong: at some point Apple may stop doing this. But that could be year's away, and in the meantime, they're throwing their big stack around to make it too costly for developers - who Apple supposedly partners with - to build businesses that are less dependent on Apple’s whims. Plus, Apple uses the fact that most subscribers to app store products subscribe on the app store itself to bolster their case with regulators that no reform is needed bc consumers are overwhelmingly happy to use Apple’s IAP systems. But if Apple is putting it's finger on the scales in order to actively drive users away from web subscriptions, then they heavily misleading these regulators about the true “choices” consumers are making.   \n",

It helped a lot that the authors had interacted with Jobs over decades and also had an understanding of business and technology that Isaacson was missing.\\n\\nThere’s also an old documentary about the founding of NeXT that does such a great job of showing what it was like to be in the room with him as a member of a small team, and this was before he fully “became” Steve Jobs. People underestimate how much meaning can be found in being pushed hard by someone with a clear and inspiring vision.\\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Udi0rk3jZYM   \n",

You might be able to snag a PDF copy online to see if it&#x27;s for you.<p>Audio Programming Book is entirely in C and can be a bit of a pain to get things working in C if you&#x27;re new to programming (although highly worth the initial struggle if you&#x27;re looking at it with a career in mind), although I&#x27;d still recommend stepping from Max&#x2F;MSP into MATLAB&#x2F;Python, which focuses on functionality rather than programming itself.<p>Python is also bit more beginner friendly, although C++ will probably end up being your long term bet.<p>I&#x27;d pick up the Pyo library for python, and&#x2F;or a tutorial like this...   \n",

       "27275649  If you're new to programming, it might also help you to get started with Max/MSP and YouTube videos that already show you how to make the mini-synth you're after (terrible as a programming environment but great as a learning/prototyping tool).\\n\\nThe Computer Music Tutorial by Curtis Roads is a good companion here if you want inner workings. You might be able to snag a PDF copy online to see if it's for you.\\n\\nAudio Programming Book is entirely in C and can be a bit of a pain to get things working in C if you're new to programming (although highly worth the initial struggle if you're looking at it with a career in mind), although I'd still recommend stepping from Max/MSP into MATLAB/Python, which focuses on functionality rather than programming itself.\\n\\nPython is also bit more beginner friendly, although C++ will probably end up being your long term bet.\\n\\nI'd pick up the Pyo library for python, and/or a tutorial like this one, after dabbling with Max/MSP a bit: https://python....   \n",

       "4     If you're new to programming, it might also help you to get started with Max/MSP and YouTube videos that already show you how to make the mini-synth you're after (terrible as a programming environment but great as a learning/prototyping tool).\\n\\nThe Computer Music Tutorial by Curtis Roads is a good companion here if you want inner workings. You might be able to snag a PDF copy online to see if it's for you.\\n\\nAudio Programming Book is entirely in C and can be a bit of a pain to get things working in C if you're new to programming (although highly worth the initial struggle if you're looking at it with a career in mind), although I'd still recommend stepping from Max/MSP into MATLAB/Python, which focuses on functionality rather than programming itself.\\n\\nPython is also bit more beginner friendly, although C++ will probably end up being your long term bet.\\n\\nI'd pick up the Pyo library for python, and/or a tutorial like this one, after dabbling with Max/MSP a bit: https://python....   \n",

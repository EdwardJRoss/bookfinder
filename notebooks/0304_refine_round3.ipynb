       "25998716  There's a recent book about this, subtitled \"The Luddites Are Right About Why You Hate Your Job\": https://www.versobooks.com/books/3184-breaking-things-at-work\\n\\n> In the nineteenth century, English textile workers responded to the introduction of new technologies on the factory floor by smashing them to bits. For years the Luddites roamed the English countryside, practicing drills and manoeuvres that they would later deploy on unsuspecting machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history; for Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of the antagonistic relationship between all workers, including us today, and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The luddites weren’t primitive and they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the twenty-first century world."

For example the &quot;when they cry&quot; series are literally visual novels (or sound novels as they like to call them), there are zero gameplay elements, and no branching, you are basically reading a book with a few illustrations and (very good) background music.<p>On the other side, some games focus so much on action that the only goal of the story is to tell you who the bad guys are and not get in the way of shooting them.   \n",

That&#x27;s when all the good electric work vehicles ship. The electric Ford F-150, the electric Ford Transit, and the big electric Freightliner trucks are all starting volume production. A year from now, most American blue-collar workers will have ridden in an electric vehicle at least once.   \n",

In the most obvious case: story branching, you have double the work for each branch, some of them may be hard to make interesting.\\n\\nSome Japanese visual novels may have great stories, but they are games in name only. For example the \"when they cry\" series are literally visual novels (or sound novels as they like to call them), there are zero gameplay elements, and no branching, you are basically reading a book with a few illustrations and (very good) background music.\\n\\nOn the other side, some games focus so much on action that the only goal of the story is to tell you who the bad guys are and not get in the way of shooting them.   \n",

For most people the economy is not working for them. \\nGlobal Environmental Disaster: Sales, many signs point to more chaotic and worse environmental conditions to come.\\nThe War Between Rich and Poor: Much like question one this one is occurring, and it's getting worse not better. Economic inequality has increased and the trend is increasing.\\n\\nSale is correct on many points, his timeline just isn't accurate.   \n",

But it’s completely absurd.\" Yes. We're in a good position on energy. As the fossil fuel sources are running out, we now have good alternatives. That wasn't true 20 years ago. 20 years ago, solar panels cost too much, and wind turbines were not big enough.\\n\\n2022 will probably be the year that perception of this turns around in the US. That's when all the good electric work vehicles ship. The electric Ford F-150, the electric Ford Transit, and the big electric Freightliner trucks are all starting volume production.

But that could be year's away, and in the meantime, they're throwing their big stack around to make it too costly for developers - who Apple supposedly partners with - to build businesses that are less dependent on Apple’s whims. Plus, Apple uses the fact that most subscribers to app store products subscribe on the app store itself to bolster their case with regulators that no reform is needed bc consumers are overwhelmingly happy to use Apple’s IAP systems. But if Apple is putting it's finger on the scales in order to actively drive users away from web subscriptions, then they heavily misleading these regulators about the true “choices” consumers are making.   \n",

            <h1>The Art of Computer Programming</h1>
            <h2>by Donald Knuth</h2>
            The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) is a comprehensive monograph written by the computer scientist
            Donald Knuth presenting programming algorithms and their analysis. Volumes 1–5 are intended to represent the
            central core of computer programming for sequential machines.

            Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in 1962. The first
            three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973.
            Work began in earnest on Volume 4 in 1973, but was suspended in 1977 for work on typesetting prompted by the
            second edition of Volume 2. Writing of the final copy of Volume 4A began in longhand in 2001, and the first
            online pre-fascicle, 2A, appeared later in 2001.

            Volume 4B is expected to consist of Fascicles 5 and 6. The manuscript was sent to the publisher on August 1,
            2022, with publication expected in October 2022. Fascicle 7, planned for Volume 4C, was the subject of
            Knuth's talk on August 3, 2022.

                    <span class="commtext c00">And its first reference is to what I consider the definitive reference on
                        the subject, at least for the state of the art in 1968: the Art of Computer Programming. Vol. 2:
                        Seminumerical Algorithms.<p>I also think the only additions that might be needed to that are
                            mentions of newer algorithms that are comparatively simple, but better. The subject itself
                            is pretty well-trodden.</p>
                        <p>Knuth does mention the extremely simple additive random number generator</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <pre><code>  Xn = (Xn-24 + Xn-55) mod m
</code></pre>
                        (And says that this can be used directly with floating point values to produce floats in the
                        range [0,1))<p>It uses 55 words of state (initialized to not all be even), needs only about ten
                            simple instructions to implement (in particular, no multiplications or divisions), has
                            period of at least 2^55-1, and Knuth said it’s very good in practice, isn’t known to be bad,
                            and ends with (in the 1980 second edition of volume 2, with the first edition being from
                            1968):</p>
                        <p><i>The only reason it is difficult to recommend sequence (7) wholeheartedly is that there is
                                very little theory to prove that it does or does not have desirable randomness
                                properties; essentially all we know for sure is that the period is very long, and this
                                is not enough”</i></p>
                        <p>I can’t find anything more recent about this RNG. Has it been forgotten, or was it shown to
                            be bad in some important sense?

                    &gt; There is also the notion of being able to make better decisions with more "connection material"
                    in your mind. The more you know, the more likely you are to make a novel connection.<p>I completely
                        agree with this, but I don't believe all blog posts and technical articles are written equal :)
                    </p>
                    <p>You have:</p>
                    <p>1. Your garden variety tech blog post about somebody's experience using X or Y framework or just
                        a general techy blog. (I'm thinking a joel spolsky or coding horror post here)</p>
                    <p>2. A technical dive into a specific problem/framework.</p>
                    <p>3. A raymond chen style blog post explaining the reasons behind some weird api.</p>
                    <p>And then you have the deeper material:</p>
                    <p>4. The Pragmatic Programmer. Not too dense and can still be enjoyed at a leisurely pace, but
                        contains enough deep thinking type of material to motivate you.</p>
                    <p>5. A comprehensive reference book about a specific framework or concept (Game Engine Architecture
                        and OpenGL SuperBible come to mind).</p>
                    <p>6. The Art of Computer Programming.</p>
                    <p>I only consider the last 3 productivity material. The first 3 can be helpful in rare instances,
                        but they're more akin to watching a 3blue1brown video where I say "That was interesting" and
                        proceed to forget all about that topic.

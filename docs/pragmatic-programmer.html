            <h1>The Pragmatic Programmer - From Journeyman to Master</h1>
            <h2>by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas</h2>
            Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing
            specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a
            requirement and
            producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal
            responsibility and
            career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse.
            Read this
            book, and you’ll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible,
            dynamic, and
            adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and
            exceptions;
            Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic
            programmers;
            and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and
            filled with
            entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates
            the best
            practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you’re a new coder,
            an
            experienced program.

                            established that that works properly, we think of a way to do it clean and tested for all

                    I also don't have a compsci background, but wanted to develop my programming skills at work. The
                    book "The Pragmatic Programmer" was recommended to me, and I feel like it made a big impact on my
                    code quality. Particularly when programming with a team. It covers higher level concepts and
                    organization in code.

                    “Write one to throw away” was a concept in one of the tech books I read. Perhaps The Pragmatic
                    Programmer or maybe The Mythical Man Month.

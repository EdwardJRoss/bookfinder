            <h1>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</h1>
            <h2>by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman </h2>


            Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula
            over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new
            implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and
            compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the
            course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the
            central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with
            state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming.
            There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream
            processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been
            reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.

                            The Pragmatic Programmer -</p>
                        <p>This changed my life when I started programming 20 years ago. Most of the practices are now
                            common, but it was almost radical back then.</p>
                        <p>- Designing Data Intensive Applications</p>
                        <p>This is so well written, so elegantly fundamental. It's an absolute pleasure, even if I don't
                            really refer to it in practice.</p>
                        <p>- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
                        <p>In many ways, the MIT version of PAIP. Its elegance complements the pragmatism of PAIP well.
                        </p>
                        <p>- The unicorn project</p>
                        <p>My number 5 book varies often, because I haven't found many books that reach the writing
                            quality of the other 4. This is a business novel, but it really solidified a lot of concepts
                            for me: lean, queues, theory of constraints, what devops is about, working as a programmer
                            in a business.

{"text":"City builders, such as Sim City or even City Skylines are all inaccurate to various degrees. I find it more \"honest\" when Tropico 6 makes fun of the concept entirely: with your hackers stealing the White House from the US Government.\n\nStrangely enough, I find Tropico to be a more believable setting.\n\n* Citizen simulation: Citizens need to travel between different areas. Miners need to enter the mines, but when they get tired, they need to travel home to rest. Every now and then, they must travel to Church to fulfil their personal religious needs (religious citizens need more church than non-religious). Etc. etc. for all the personal needs of citizens (food, housing, religion, entertainment). Citizens also grow up: adults give birth to children, children go to school (or not: if you don't have schools they'll grow up uneducated), 20 years later they enter the workforce as either \"uneducated\", \"high school\" educated, or \"college educated\". Higher education levels can perform more jobs (ex: Petro-chemical engineer), while uneducated are forced into the lowest wage jobs (farming or mining).\n\nYou do need farmers and miners however. So you kind of need to balance the number of high and low educated fellows in your island.\n\n* The economy: Tropico simulates a small island country in a world of \"Superpowers\". Tropico 6 has 4 ages and therefore different sets of superpowers. Early ages is \"The Crown\" (the sole superpower), your hypothetical king who sent you to colonize the island. Then comes \"Axis\" and \"Allies\" as the two superpowers. A few decades later you get USSR vs USA. Finally the superpowers split into the modern age (Europe, USA, Russia, China).\n\n* You're a small fish in the world. Your entire economy consists of satisfying the superpowers with goods. More advanced goods means more money from a superpower. Too much relations with one superpower (ex: USA) will piss off rival superpowers (ex: USSR in Cold War era).\n\n----------\n\nThis leads to some very believable situations:\n\n* The city center naturally flows from the harbor: your sole connection to the superpowers of the world. While there's some trade / economy within Tropico (ex: various food items, meat, entertainment, and maybe tourism), the vast majority of your wealth will be from trade with the superpowers you're aligned with.\n\n* Rich vs Poor citizens -- Poor citizens work the mines. Educated citizens can be university professors, pharmacists, or engineers (who can turn raw petroleum into plastic and sell for even more money to the superpowers). Rich people want to live in nice houses and drive cars. Poor citizens can't even afford to ride the bus and walk everywhere (meaning you need to plan poor communities very differently than rich communities).\n\n* \"Ghettos\" -- If you have a valuable resource in a far-off corner of your island (such as Coal, Gold, Bauxite, Oil, or Uranium), you naturally have to build a mine over there. But your workers also need to live there (otherwise they'll spend too much time traveling between the city center and the mine, never actually working). Your compromise is to build a low-quality housing area... a \"Ghetto\", with just barely enough needs to survive. That way, your workers are encouraged to stay on that corner of the island without spending too much of their free time walking back and forth to the higher quality town center. Raw materials (mines) don't have as much value as higher-grades of products, so its not worth the investment improving that corner of the island.\n\nBesides, if you upgraded all of the housing in the \"Ghetto\" area, those workers couldn't afford those houses. I guess you can enact the \"free housing\" edict, but that pisses of the USA-superpower (though it makes you closer to the USSR...). Free-housing also means free: you no longer get income from homes but instead lose money on every house. So its harder to make money.\n\n-----------\n\nCeasar / Pharaoh also did the rich/poor thing better IMO (the richest citizens leave the workforce!! You may suddenly find yourself in a worker shortage if you \"upgrade\" your citizens too far). A big issue with Sim City / City Skylines is that the entire interaction of rich / poor is completely neglected.","meta":{"id":28063495,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":false,"seed_parent":false,"seed_sibling":false,"ask_hn_books":false,"work_of_art":true,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":-388034598,"_task_hash":-1803981613,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1662553009}
{"text":"> The fact that the canon wasn't fixed doesn't mean the apocryphal books were part of it\n\nThat's not the point. The point is that there wasn't a single canon, different sects of Jews had different canons. All these canons were overlapping \u2013 all Jews accepted the Torah, there was widespread (but not universal) acceptance of the Prophets; the third part of the Jewish canon, the Writings (Ketuvim) saw the most disagreement.  And we have evidence that the canon of the Qumran community did include books now considered \"apocryphal\"\u2013see https://www.jstor.org/stable/24663170\n\nDid some Greek-speaking Jews include \"apocryphal\" works in their canon, just as the Qumran community did? Well, we have evidence that the Qumran community included Greek-speaking Jews \u2013 most of the Dead Sea Scrolls were in Hebrew or Aramaic, but some Greek texts were recovered as well.\n\nWe know that many Greek-speaking early Christians accepted some of the pre-Christian Greek \"apocryphal\"/\"deuterocanonical\" works as canonical. Why did they do that? Well, a very plausible hypothesis is that some Hellenistic Jews already accepted them as canonical, and Hellenistic Christianity inherited that acceptance from (segments of) Hellenistic Judaism. We don't have direct proof of that, but as a historical hypothesis it is very plausible, especially in light of the evidence from Qumran that some Jews (even Greek-speaking ones) did accept (other) \"apocryphal\" works in their canon.\n\n> And that's besides the fact that even if there was some so-called \"debate\" about it, if the canon didn't actually change as a result of those debates (e.g. Song of Songs and Eccl. are part of the canon), then how can you say it wasn't fixed?\n\nThe canon did change. In the middle of the second century CE, the Pharisees still had multiple canons \u2013 a narrow canon which excluded Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes, a broad canon which included them, and also a couple of intermediate canons which included one but not the other. The outcome of this debate was that the broad canon won out over the narrow and intermediate ones, and supporters of those other canons died out.\n\nAnd, if we consider other Jewish groups such as the Sadducees or the Qumran community, we find even more Jewish canons than that. However, the 1st and 2nd centuries CE saw a great deal of decline in the diversity of Judaism, due to various factors (the trauma of the Jewish-Roman wars, competition from Christianity), and part of that decline in diversity was the reduction of multiple canons to one. But that reduction did not complete until after Christianity had already split off from Judaism, which is why many Christians (both in the early Church, and also today) do not believe that Christians are bound by it.\n\nAnd why do you dismiss it as 'some so-called \"debate\"'? It was a real debate, you can read the Mishnah for yourself \u2013 https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.3.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en \u2013 allow me to quote some of it:\n\n> All the Holy Scriptures defile the hands. The Song of Songs and Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) defile the hands. Rabbi Judah says: the Song of Songs defiles the hands, but there is a dispute about Kohelet. Rabbi Yose says: Kohelet does not defile the hands, but there is a dispute about the Song of Songs. Rabbi Shimon says: [the ruling about] Kohelet is one of the leniencies of Bet Shammai and one of the stringencies of Bet Hillel.\n\nAll the Rabbis it quotes are known to have been active in the 2nd century CE. So in the 2nd century CE, there was a real debate among the (successors of the) Pharisees about the canonicity of Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes.\n\nFurthermore, this passage gives evidence that the same debate was active in the 1st century CE as well (and possibly even the 1st century BCE too), through Rabbi Shimon's reference to Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel.","meta":{"id":28519890,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":false,"seed_parent":false,"seed_sibling":false,"ask_hn_books":false,"work_of_art":true,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":-1860014417,"_task_hash":-1696826490,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1662553035}

I was in charge of accessibility of another Microsoft Studio that worked on Hololens software.\n\nFor MuseScore 4 (currently in development), I have made sure that every bit of UI passes web accessibility contrast standards and I have designed a new 'High Contrast Mode' which is being implemented right now.

{"text":"Familiarity can run fairly deep.\n\nIn an established Windows-based desktop network where each office worker has their own PC & apps optimized for that user's particular workflow, this can be one of the most productive arrangements that can be leveraged to make the difference between a low-productivity bureaucracy and high-productivity, whether it remains paperwork-intensive or works completely paperless.\n\nThe early adopters of DOS who followed directly to Windows in their offices were most likely to have this bit well established (though it was far from universal), and enjoyed its advantages quite a number of years in advance of the internet appearing on the horizon.  Regardless some offices still had one dedicated DOS PC for email purposes and directly logging in to clients' or vendors' private servers by dial-up modem, just like it was before there was any consideration to network certain desktops together much less join them all to a future internet if any.\n\nWith the arrival of built-in Windows Networking in Windows 98 and the dominance of Ethernet for both office LAN and internet WAN, the clear advantage of having the dedicated office workers and their apps remain fully productive without relying on dial-up or later broadband cannections to outside resources became more & more blurred.\n\nLinux was still in its infancy.  It has been made to accomodate Windows Networking ever since.\n\nRemember email came out in DOS way before the WWW came around, and in that respect webmail is the killer app.\n\nIt is still considered too challenging for an IT administrator to switch this whole shebang over from Windows to Linux, it's like stepping off into the unknown to some extent or another, and there's too much at stake at one time.  But one approach is to backtrack into known successful configurations and see if you can fork differently from there.\n\nOne of the most viable approaches is to insure the local Windows network has maximum functionality and productivity without requring connection to the web.  Somewhat like the old days.\n\nThen treat the web as a special case just like it used to be when you had to wisely set aside a whole dial-up session for a potentially unreliable connection.\n\nOnly now its lots quicker to just reboot to Linux for the occasional web use, then back to Windows for regular office work.\n\nVery few offices actually benefit from having all the office machines be online to the WWW all the time.\n\nPeople find Linux much easier if the only thing they have to use it for is email and browsing the internet and other web activities only.  Not much training or support burden needed for such limited utilization.\n\nThey are already using things other than Windows to be online all the time on their own devices now, so it's much more realistic to get them to do the web function exclusively in Linux on their office machines before even trying to migrate the vast remainder of integrated Windows workflows into a hopefully-compatible Linux equivalent.\n\nThis is just a way of functionally recognizing that Windows has continued to become less suitable for the internet for some time now, and Linux is becoming more suitable for high-productivity office work but was not suitable enough fast enough.\n\nThey did not meet in the middle where one can completely be substituted for the other, but can be handled separately to some advantage.\n\nEveryone would be running full desktop Linux each time they went on the web which is easy to get accustomed to, they could further become familiar with more extensive Linux capabilities at their own pace without fearing a show-stopper which could break the carefully-honed Windows workflow.\n\nThose few workers who do need to be on the internet almost all the time would be the ones who need to be able to use Linux for almost everything.\n\nEven if Linux was perfected, everyone else can only adopt it at a limited pace so there needs to be clear priorities but this is one possible step toward the light at the end of the tunnel.","meta":{"id":29452905,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":true,"seed_parent":false,"seed_sibling":false,"ask_hn_books":false,"work_of_art":false,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":419917490,"_task_hash":-198636731,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1662552593}

{"text":"I have not had time to read a lot of books, one (475 page) book I read is \"Androids\" by Chet Haase.  Haase was on the Android team and interviewed most of the programmers who wrote the initial Android versions.  I program Android and find it fascinating.  It gives you an idea of how such a successful project from somewhat recent times comes together.  Android was originally going to be an operating system for cameras written in Javascript.\n\nIt covers a big team, and jumps from chapter to chapter on how the Java virtual machine was written, to how the SD card code was written, to how notifications were implemented.  Thus it does not have the compelling narrative drive of something like Masters of Doom, which is another good book which follows a much smaller group from id software.  But Androids is a very informative book on how something like Android is put together.\n\nAlso, some books of this type are for the lay person and are breezy and talk about personalities and not much about technical matters.  A lay person could probably read this, but it does dive into technical decisions, which I appreciated.  For example, I knew Android has a process called zygote which handles the initialization of each Android application, but this book explains why such a process exists, which illuminates things for me beyond me simply knowing that it does exist.\n\nAlso interesting is how the teams from Danger, Palmsource, and WebTV came in with various ideas of how a device should be built, which all culminated in Android.\n\nIf you are interested in great prose or a narrative drive, read another book.  If you are interested in how the folks from Danger (and Palmsource, and WebTV) had great success at their second swing at bat, in creating a technology that has become ubiquitous worldwide in the past decade with three billion active Android devices - it is an interesting read.","meta":{"id":29674241,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":false,"seed_parent":false,"seed_sibling":true,"ask_hn_books":true,"work_of_art":true,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":-1632946200,"_task_hash":-1276953019,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1662551560}

{"text":"I think a lot of americans enter adulthood only exposed to \"classics\" as older english-language works. The prose and especially dialog in those doesn't flow naturally to contemporary english speakers so feels a little difficult or stilted. Familiarity with it needs to be earned before making confident aesthetic judgements.\n\nFor the russian classics the translation trend for decades has been a little more terse and less ornate sentence-by-sentence. Which I think flows naturally and makes it feel more modern to contemporary english speakers. This often surprises people! But the russian classics can be a more fun, modern-feeling read than the english ones.\n\nIt's one of the advantages of translated works. They can be continually retranslated into the target language as its vernacular and cadence changes. Same-language works are stuck forever with the dialect of the time, and \"paraphrases\" into modern vernacular are met with much more skepticism than new translations are.","meta":{"id":29674411,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":false,"seed_parent":false,"seed_sibling":false,"ask_hn_books":true,"work_of_art":true,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":468073103,"_task_hash":-1906095359,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1662552145}

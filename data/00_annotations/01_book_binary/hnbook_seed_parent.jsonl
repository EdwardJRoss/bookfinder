{"text":"This post is such a breath of fresh air!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who has come to realize that a lot of \"clean\" code is actually just developers trying to be clever or scratch an itch of obsessive-compulsion.\n\nRepetition isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If the repetition isn't difficult to alter and it more clearly describes what is happening on a step by step basis, it's difficult for me to call that \"dirty\".\n\nCode is for humans, not computers, first and foremost.  Certain things necessitate performance early on, but for a lot of projects it isn't reasonable for all code to make absolute logical sense from the get-go.  What's more important is that people can read the code and understand it without undue deciphering.\n\nSometimes I come back to code that I've written long ago.  When I wrote that code, I almost always thought I was writing \"clean code\".  It often turns out that the code I was immediately able to understand and make changes to was the code that had repetition, wasn't mindlessly spread out into a bunch of \"tiny functions\", and had comments spread out to describe my reasoning.\n\nIn contrast, \"clean\" code is often inherently hard to change because it relies on centralizing functionality.  When you centralize something and you change it, it may work for one circumstance but mysteriously cause something else to break.  With repetition, your code base might be larger but code may be more decoupled and thus easier to make a small change to fix one thing without breaking another similar thing.","meta":{"id":29242263,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":false,"seed_parent":true,"seed_sibling":true,"ask_hn_books":false,"work_of_art":false,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":630352709,"_task_hash":-1080928526,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1662552663}

{"text":"As many Heinlein fans may recall, one working title for the book was \"A Martian Named Smith\".\n\nYour comment echoes that of Orville Prescott (\"disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire and cheap eroticism.\") , mentioned both in Vonnegut's review and at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land#Reception .\n\n\"Memorable\" to you now is certainly different than 1990, when Vonnegut wrote, or 1961 when it was first released.\n\nIt was released at the start of the sexual revolution. American views on sex were already in flux - look at the reaction to the Kinsey Reports around 1950. Moreover, Heinlein timed the publication because \"I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. I could see them changing and it turned out that I had timed it right.\" (Quote from that Wikipedia page.)\n\n\"The kidz\" turning 20 now were born 40 years after the book came out, over a decade after the AIDS crisis, in a world where discussions about sex are much more common. Heinlein wrote Stranger \"to shake the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines\" (Quote from that Wikipedia page.)\n\nI think few kidz now consider mid-20th century ideas to be new and fresh. For that matter, how many young Asimov fans are there these days?\n\nI don't much like Dune. However, I recognize the impact it had for its era, like its treatment of planetary ecology, written in the new Silent Spring era.\n\nI think the same applies to Stranger.

{"text":"Sure, the universities could raise tuition, but that wouldn't take away their incentive to save money on textbooks. I should add that this would work best if the university provides the books to the students and then takes them back at the end of the semester (of course charging for those damaged or not returned and with the option to keep and pay for it if you want to). This way, the same books can be reused for many semesters.\n\nBuying used or copying textbooks is becoming less and less viable as textbook publishers \"bundle\" required things like online access codes for quizzes that are one time use and only sold with the new book. These can't be copied or resold because they usually contain quizzes that are auto-graded and sent to the professor.\n\nJournal access is a different problem because the big journal aggregator companies seem to have a near monopoly.\n\nMost textbooks have quite a few options, even free options, because any professor anywhere can publish a textbook, and many actually do.\n\nThe way textbooks work now, the people making the decision on which books or book bundles to go with have almost no skin in the game when it comes to price. So why not pick the Cadillac of textbooks Everytime. Or heck, just pick the textbook from the company with the slickest and biggest marketing budget.\n\nRight now, many professors switch to the newest edition every 2 years or so. Watch how much longer colleges keep using the old editions of college algebra when they are going to have to shell out the cash to buy new editions. I think the students probably won't miss out on all that new basic math that gets discovered every few years.","meta":{"id":27417190,"seed_book":false,"seed_child":false,"seed_parent":true,"seed_sibling":false,"ask_hn_books":false,"work_of_art":false,"zero_shot_80":false},"_input_hash":456550446,"_task_hash":-1433194496,"label":"BOOK","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1662552722}

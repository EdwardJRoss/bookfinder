It\u2019s a good opportunity to learn, and a good sign that your team cares about code quality and continuous improvement.\n\nYou mention bugs specifically, for which I think the best remedies are good unit tests and careful consideration of edge cases (which often go hand in hand). Other smaller issues such as deviation from framework conventions and performance problems can be helped by getting to know your languages, frameworks and database better, which comes with time. More generally, there are lots of good resources out there to help you improve the readability and structure of your code - Clean Code by Robert Martin (particularly the earlier chapters) and Sandi Metz\u2019s books and talks are both good starting points. Issues with your general approach to solving problems are harder to address, but reviewing others\u2019 code, learning about design patterns and pair programming can all help here.\n\nIn terms of actionable advice, I\u2019d encourage you to briefly discuss your intended approach to a problem with a colleague before starting work: this can help expose issues in advance.

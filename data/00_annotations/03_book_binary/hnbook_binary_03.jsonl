This traditionally involves legwork, such as contacting the same sources quoted in the first article to verify that facts are true.\n\nThis legwork is usually done by traditionally respected publications (i.e. not just copying and pasting). Other outlets and blogs with different goals do blatantly copy and paste, which produces articles less valuable than those traditionally matched.\n\nMatching\u2014versus copying and pasting\u2014is important because it avoids the spread of false reports. From \"The Elements of Journalism\" by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel: \"Originality is a bulwark of better journalism, deeper understanding, and more accurate reporting. [\u2026] In the era before curation and aggregation, the tradition of \u201cmatching\u201d stories was rooted in the same idea. Rather than publishing another news outlet\u2019s scoop, journalists tended to require one of their reporters to call a source to confirm it first. This tradition of matching was a way for news organizations to avoid having to credit their rivals, which in this earlier era was considered an embarrassing admission of being scooped. Yet the tradition of matching had another more important and salutary effect.

Seen from the human side with no exploration of the enemy except that they exist.\n\nPeter F. Hamilton has this idea in a couple of his books; one is Morning-Light-Mountain[1] which is an alien hive-intelligence which outcompeted all others in its solar system. The other is a trans-human faction starting to go the same way, \"multiple-people\" who clone themselves and have brain implants to sync their brain state into one mind shared between all their clones. Only on the small scale of a few dozen bodies, not a competitive intelligence. They're smaller plot parts in large space operas.\n\nJohn Windham's Midwitch Cuckoos, the alien children are believed to be a hive mind, as teaching something to one of them turns into something all of them can do. Also seen from the outside, we never find out about their origins or the adult aliens.\n\n(In the film Avatar, the aliens have a tree where they can tap into the wisdom of their ancestors, it turns out to be a kind of hive-mind of the dead).\n\n[1] https://peterfhamilton.fandom.com/wiki/Morning-Light-Mountain\n\n[2] https://classicsofsciencefiction.com/2019/03/01/rogue-farm-by-charles-stross/","meta":{"id":26858310},"_input_hash":1718604341,"_task_hash":-2064692270,"label":"WORK_OF_ART","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1668549619}

And after that only slept max 3 hours for ages (nearly a year).\n- I couldn\u2019t take naps \n- I lost all my energy (could hardly walk for 15), thinking etc \n- had to chase after specialists to check things, and correct them on their assumptions... which was emotionally exhaustive.\n- It led to them seeing symptoms of an endless list of possible causes, but they never found a culprit. \n- One hypothesis was that I was struggling with the results of a virus, and basically was left with all kinds of damage. \n- I was constantly asked about / advised on bed / food / daily routines, even though mine were identical to their advice (perfect) going into this, and I had been stress free.\n\n[ on improvement ]\n\n+ It\u2019s hard to say if it helped me improve my sleep, since I continued to struggle, but a very strict (though fairly standard) bed routine did make me feel more in control:\n* same time to bed every day, pre-bed routine of stretching the body, cooling my hands and feet, while in bed stretching the face muscles and \u2018yawning\u2019\n* no exciting media or social meeting / discussions in the evening (or close to bed time)\n* using an app to play the same comforting / funny podcast every night, and having it fade out after a set time (the Ricky Gervais show / pilkboys yt channel) \n* For a while I developed my own meditation routine in bed\n\n+ asked people to not ask about my sleep, just how I\u2019m doing\n+ be very open, forward, non apologetic about your condition\n+ there might have been an influence of some gut problems I had, which were eventually treated by antibiotics\n+ I\u2019ve been prescribed temazepam and diazepam to at least calm my body down, and it made me feel closer to sinking into sleep \u2013 but never really went all the way. I got semi addicted to them, and hated the desperation I had to at least have some control over my body. After I got off them, and my twitches had declined,  I only used temazepam if im on my way to a second sleepless night in a row. So I don\u2019t reach  for them on th occasional setback, but I\u2019m glad they are there if it escalates.\n\n+  I focus on daily activities, and excused myself from existential worries\n+ I\u2019m now up to 5 / 6 hours on a night, not necessarily of quality, but I don\u2019t feel terrible every day","meta":{"id":27475670},"_input_hash":992533983,"_task_hash":-630044718,"label":"WORK_OF_ART","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1668829582}

{"text":"> compiles against its own version of the C/C++ standard library\n\nThe C++ library yes.  However IIRC Windows now ships a conforming somehow-modern C standard library (ucrt) and modern MSVCs link to it.  It is probably also included in current redistributables for the still supported (by MSVC) old versions of Windows that did not have it.  Also, the forever binary incompatible C++ standard lib had its limit regardless of the platform (more because of 3rd party binary libs) and MS has switched to a backward binary compatible C++ redistributable for a few years now (they may rebreak in the future).\n\nSo on some points (but not all, and it is likely to never be all) the situation is converging.\n\n>  to avoid the classic nonsense that every Linux user sees when they build a binary and bring it to an older OS\n\nThe thing with building a binary-only program for \"Linux\" is that \"Linux\" is not a single OS, and you don't really have cross-distro binary compat except by luck, and for the different versions of a same distro they concentrate on rebuilding everything from source, plus you have a unified namespace of symbols in ELFs so you would not be able to load 2 different C++ libs anyway.  This brings drawbacks, but also advantages (for ex you can use C++ libraries of the platform, with an unconstrained C++ API)\n\nSo the end result is kind of what you say, except if you want things to work really well you should probably even do:\n\n* a specific native package for each distro (maybe \u00d7 version)\n* try to dynamically link to the fewest possible libs of the platform, ideally only glibc (and yes, an old enough one), maybe also libstdc++ if you want to support plugins, and maybe others if they come with a compatibility policy (so on a case by case basis)\n* or target something else than a native distro (ex: flatpak, appimage), although it is sometimes kind of equivalent to yet other distros -- anyway at this point it starts to resemble to how you would distribute a binary for Windows -- so with those possibilities existing it is just that under a GNU/Linux distro you also have the classic/more-integrated ones.\n\nAnyway, Chrome manages to do binary packages for various version of Debian, and probably other distros; likewise for VS Code and Virtual Box. And building for multiple targets is arguably less a pain today than 10 years ago.","meta":{"id":29333670},"_input_hash":1534372357,"_task_hash":-1248954945,"label":"WORK_OF_ART","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1668829638}

{"text":"> I think we also see some of this in Christian stuff. I feel like Christians like Isaiah 11:6's \"the lion will lie down with the lamb\" (yes, I know that technically that's not quite the animals in the text, but it is how I often hear it said by English-language Christians). I think the idea that predators might not be predators in some world-to-come isn't something that has to be creatively reinterpreted.\n\nThere's sort of a verse that deals with it. The context is in eating meat sacrificed to idols, aka immoral meat. It's not clear on what that means, where it's eating meat in a ceremonial service or buying meat in the marketplace that was resold donations to a pagan temple. Romans 14: 1-9\n\n>>Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters.  One person's faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. Who are you to judge someone else's servant?\n\n>>To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.\nOne person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. 6 Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. 7 For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.\n\nI'm not Christian any more, but generally the spirit is more \"your brother needs to be vegan, don't convert him or argue with him and do your best to strengthen his faith.\" Each person must do what he feels God has commanded him to do in his own way.\n\nThe new heaven and new earth is a radically different experience. Its not just lion laying down with lamb, its that \"we shall neither marry nor be given in marriage, and be like the angels\" which Jesus said in answer to people disbelieving in a ressurection.  It's a total break from humanity in a sense, and trying to emulate it has led to a lot of cults engaging in self-destructive behavior.","meta":{"id":27664956},"_input_hash":-104965577,"_task_hash":1884286326,"label":"WORK_OF_ART","_view_id":"classification","answer":"ignore","_timestamp":1668830336}

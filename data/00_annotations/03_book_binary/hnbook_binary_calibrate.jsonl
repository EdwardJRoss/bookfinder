That being said, I think that Jobs provided much more value to the world.\n\nWozniak's chief contribution to the world is the Apple II.  It is a wonderful computer with fun stories behind its development, but the computer industry would have gone on without it.  Apple's early years are culturally significant since it was one of the few success stories that wasn't corporate (in contrast to the Commodore PET and Tandy TRS-80), but that story is probably the most significant part about the company.\n\nContrast that to Jobs.  As a minimum, the Apple II and Macintosh can be contributed to him.  Without his drive, the Apple II would likely be remembered as one of the multitude of personal computers that didn't make it in the marketplace.  Without his drive, the GUI as a consumer product would have been set back years and would probably have looked very different.  As expensive as the original Macintosh was, it was far less expensive than many of its contemporaries.  As crude as the original Macintosh user interface was, it did provide a model for later products.  Perhaps his antagonistic attitude towards user serviceability takes away from that, but it isn't all that different from how appliances were treated in the mid-1980's.\n\nEdit: expanded a couple of sentences for clarity.","meta":{"id":27783556,"prob_group":2,"prob":0.2602133568},"_input_hash":-798050155,"_task_hash":-130585046,"label":"WORK_OF_ART","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1668831896}

Existing explanations focus on the characteristics of bullshitters, the nature of the audience, and social structural factors which encourage bullshitting. In this paper, I offer an alternative explanation: bullshitting is a social practice that organizational members engage with to become part of a speech community, to get things done in that community, and to reinforce their identity. When the practice of bullshitting works, it can gradually expand from a small group to take over an entire organization and industry.

The only way the regress can terminate is with an uncaused cause, which only can be met by a godlike being.  So followed to its logical conclusion Dawkins argument proves the existence of god.\n\nSam Harris seems to think the problem of evil disproves god, yet most philosophers now believe it does not after Alvin Plantinga's work.  At any rate, at best it can disprove a good god.\n\nDennett doesn't seem to have an argument, and just tried to explain away everything he doesn't believe in.\n\nHitchens also doesn't have an argument and relies on emotional appeals, claiming god is like the north korean dictator, the irony apparently being lost on him that north korea is a forced atheist state.\n\nSo overall the most glaring problem is lack of any argument whatsoever, which is not promising for a supposedly intellectual position.  When an argument is offered it would not even pass a freshman logic class.\n\nPrior generations of atheists were not so intellectually vapid.  Anthony Flew would be a good example if it were not for his conversion to theism.\n\nOh one more thing, all of the besides Hitchens erroneously like to rely on computer science to support their claims.

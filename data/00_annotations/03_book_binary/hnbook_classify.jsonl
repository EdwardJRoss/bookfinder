{"text":"Since 2016... yes, more or less.\n\nWebpack became the de-facto standard for bundling for a few years there, but everybody hated configuring it, so it dramatically increased the \"out-of-the-box\" configuration. That said, the ES module standard has started to make its way into the world, so there are more than a few bundlers these days that aim to do Webpack's job better. They've also learned from years past, and most try very hard to remain \"zero-config\".\n\nTypeScript has become extremely widespread, and has finally reached a reasonable level of maturity, in the sense that 1. most libraries now come with type definitions, and 2. its type system is sophisticated enough to express (and infer types for) common Javascript patterns. For non-Typescript code, Babel is still quite common, although like I mentioned, most bundlers are trying to avoid making you explicitly configure your compiler, so it's much less of a PITA to get working.\n\nIn runtime-land, I can only really speak to React. It's come quite a long way in the past couple years- the main difference is the introduction of \"function components\" rather than the previous \"class MyComponent extends React.Component\". These function components use a new effect/state management architecture (called 'hooks') that's sort of like a DSL. Personally I really like it, but it's kinda divisive. Next.JS has emerged as sort of the standard \"React front-end framework\", and it's quite nice- again, people took \"Javascript fatigue\" pretty seriously, so there's much less fussy configuration.\n\nIn semi-related tech, GraphQL has become quite popular for APIs, and there are a few libraries out there to help handle it.\n\nOh, and the Prettier formatter became popular, for whatever reason, which makes me want to bang my head against a wall because in spite of the name, it makes everything it touches uglier.\n\nAnyways, I know that was kind of a wall of text, but the takeaway here is that although a bunch of new stuff happened, FE tooling is definitely trying to be more mature and avoid a Cambrian explosion of new stuff like there was back then.

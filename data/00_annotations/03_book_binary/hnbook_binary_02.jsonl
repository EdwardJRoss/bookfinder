South Tip of Florida is good for launching but not enough empty space for testing, and inland America has loads of empty space for testing but unless govt changes policy, they can't launch from there\n\nI think Texas needs to realize that Boca chica will become the next Cape Canaveral / Area 51 combo thingy, and the Texas public Road/ Public Beach laws won't mean much.\n\nSo, either totally shut down the project NOW before it balloons to become the airport to mars, or accept that it has the same significance as say, a govt weapons testing site and effectively lock access to the entire area.
